## The past, present and future of emissions.

## Problem formulation:
Our project aims to analyze global emissions, using datasets which has several years of data to develop predictive models that forecast the potential increases/decreases in emissions in the future. This research is crucial as it addresses the direct impact of emissions on the future of humanity, highlighting the urgency for immediate change. The expected and hoped positive outcome from this project is a large awakening not only among individuals but more importantly among governments worldwide, motivating a hopeful change in how we live, so that the planet and future generations may live and ensure the survival of the human race.

### Context: 
Global emissions have time and time again shown us that it is slowly killing the planet and ecosystems. Itâ€™s adamant that we do something about it soon, as emissions rise dramatically every year.
### Purpose:
The purpose of this project aims to analyze global emissions, using datasets that have several years of data to develop predictive models that forecast the potential increases/decreases in emissions in the future. This research is crucial as it addresses the direct impact of emissions on the future of humanity, highlighting the urgency for immediate change.
### Research questions: 
-Which countries are producing the most emission?  
-Which countries are producing most emission per capita? <br>
-How have global emissions changed over the past 70 years? <br>
-Which models can we use and fit the best for our datasets? 
### Hypothesis:
-Predictive models will indicate a continued global increase in emissions at varying rates by country, unless drastic policy measures are implemented to halt it. <br>
-Some smaller countries in terms of population having equal emission as other countries with a higher population due to the overall wealth and/or living standards of the average person.
### Expected solution / positive impact / which category of users:
-A basic analysis of emission trends over the past 70 years, showcasing the seriousness and increasing speed of our global emission, combined with predictive models forecasting our future potential emission trends based on our datasets.

## Motivation
Our motivation for this project and this exact subject is because it truly matters. It's important for our future and for the future generations to come. We hear so much about climate and emissions in the news but never realized how serious it actually was and how high the numbers were. Seeing the dataset motivated us to look into it more and dive deeper into the data.
This only showed more seriousness as our current emissions can increase nearly double in just the next 30 years if we don't do something about it.
While unrealistic considering the somewhat limited level of research, if continued further and studied more extensively, it could potentially inform policy-makers, businesses or individuals to realize that this is a real problem, just like us before we went into this study.


## Theoretical foundation
Our fundamental/foundation knowledge includes undertanding the importance of data cleaning and processing, so that we can guarantee a higher level of accuracy and usability/reliability of our predictive models. This includes methods to remove empty values/null values, outliers, irrelevant variables and so on. This ensures the dataset used is suitable for analysis.
Our main focus on our datasets have been linear regression due to not only being in our semester's curriculum, but also because they are fitting for our specific datasets as they are solely numeral. 
So all-in-all, our theoretical foundation is not only about data preparation but also the decision-making and choice of which predictive model we decided to use.

## Argumentation of Choice
We have kind of already mentioned this further up but so I will keep it some-what short.
We decided to choose this specific subject for our BI exam because it is not only interesting, but also relevant and important for our future.
Choosing something that is personally interesting and relevant makes it more "fun" and enjoyable, which directly influences our work-ethic and motivation. For the main models of choice, we felt like it fit the best. As our data is mainly numeral there was no real need for other models that focus more on the inclusion of ordinal data and so on. Therefore we decided to go with Linear regression and multi-linear regression as our main models.

## Design
For design and visualization we decided to make a streamlit that showcases our main and most important data, as well as some user inputs that can actively in real-time show our data. Our design consists of different tabs where we go through the process and show the most important graphs and predictive model as well as our model's accuracy.

## Outcomes
The direct result of our analysis is that global emissions are still skyrocketing despite all the efforts in the western world to try and combat it. As for our prediction model, we tested what global emissions would be like in 2050 and the results were alarming. Our current global emissions per year is 35000 CO2e. In 2050 it will be nearly 50000 CO2e.
Meanwhile our Per Capita findings show that both major and minor countries are falling in emissions Per Capita, especially those countries with a overall "richer" average population, whereas countries like China and India are still increasing a lot.
